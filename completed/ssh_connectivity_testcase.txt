Scenario:
Testing SSH connectivity using Password and Key based auth

Prerequisite:
* Make sure the IP or hostname is reachable through the network. E.g if any VPN is needed to access the system 
* Ensure test system is pingable.
* SSH need to be installed and running on test system. 
* For key-based authentication, user must had generated the ssh key pair.
* For password authentication, user must have the correct password to provide at prompt
* Clear the known_host file to avoid any possible issue in case some modification was made to the host that is relevant to ssh connectivity

Procedure:
* Open terminal
* Attempt to connect to server providing the test user
* Specify the correct ssh command by specifying any additional parameters such as IP/hostname, port to connect or even ciphers/algorithms to be used for the connections. 
* Provide either password or key to authenticate with server. If key based auth, specify identity file or passphrase if needed. 
* Terminate SSH session

Expected results:
* Pass criteria - User is able to access to the system with the specified parameters
* Fail criteria - User is unable to connect to remote system with the provided key or password

Tools:
* Server or Workstation with ssh access enabled
* SSH client
